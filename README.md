DOMAIN: FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:

The E-Learning Platform Front-End Project is a fully responsive, interactive multi-page application built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no backend or frameworks involved. The purpose of this project is to simulate a real-world e-learning experience, where users can browse courses, track their learning progress, and watch video lessons. It’s designed to be visually engaging, user-friendly, and adaptable for future backend integration.

Objectives:
The main goal of this project is to showcase:
How front-end technologies can be used to build dynamic and engaging web applications.
How to organize UI components like sidebars, tabs, and interactive elements such as search and video embedding.
Real-world skills like DOM manipulation, state management with JavaScript, and CSS animations and responsiveness.

Key Features:
1. Multi-Page UI with Navigation Tabs
The app consists of three main "pages": Courses, Progress, and Video — all controlled through tab switching. Clicking on each navigation item dynamically loads the respective content without reloading the page.
2. Course Listing with Progress Tracking
The Courses tab displays a list of all available courses. Each course shows its title and a visual progress bar indicating completion status. Completed courses are styled differently to highlight their finished state.
3. Search Functionality
Users can search for any course in real-time. The search bar filters courses as the user types, making it easier to find a specific course in a long list.
4. Embedded Video Playback
Clicking on a course opens its associated YouTube video in the Video tab. This simulates the user experience of accessing and watching learning content directly on the platform.
5. Progress Overview
The Progress tab summarizes the learning status across all courses, with individual progress bars. This gives users a high-level view of how far they’ve come.
6. Dark Mode Toggle
The platform supports dark mode, which is a popular and important feature in modern web applications. A simple toggle switch allows users to change the theme instantly, and the entire color scheme updates smoothly.
7. Responsive Design
The layout is designed to adapt to different screen sizes. On smaller screens (like tablets or mobile phones), the sidebar rearranges to maintain usability and aesthetics.
8. Beautiful UI & Animations
Smooth transitions, hover effects, card shadows, and animations make the interface feel modern and professional. This creates a better user experience and keeps users engaged.

Tech Stack:
HTML5: Used for semantic layout and structural elements.
CSS3: Utilized for all styling, layout control, theme customization (light/dark), and animations.
JavaScript: Handles DOM manipulation, dynamic rendering, tab switching, filtering, video updating, and theme toggling.

Learning Outcomes:
By building this project, you gain hands-on experience with:
Building a multi-page SPA-like interface using only front-end code.
Structuring clean and reusable HTML layouts.
Writing modular, functional JavaScript for real-time interactivity.
Creating responsive designs without frameworks like Bootstrap.
Implementing accessibility considerations through contrast and clean structure.

Conclusion:
This front-end-only E-learning platform is a perfect mini-project for showcasing your skills in a portfolio, practicing client-side logic, or as a foundation for a full-stack version in the future. It simulates real-world product thinking — combining design, usability, and interactivity in a way that’s practical and visually appealing.
